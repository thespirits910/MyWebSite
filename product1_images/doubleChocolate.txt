Double Chocolate Cookies

Indulge in our irresistible Double Chocolate Cookies, crafted with a rich, chocolatey twist. Each cookie is made with real butter, pure vanilla extract, and a blend of brown sugar and cane sugar, but with the added decadence of cocoa powder for a deep chocolate flavor. Loaded with semi-sweet chocolate chips and a touch of sea salt, these cookies deliver a satisfyingly chewy interior and a crispy edge.

Sold as a pack of three, these cookies pair perfectly with our array of hot and cold drinks. Enjoy them with a Honey Cinnamon Latte for a spiced, comforting match or with an Iced Pumpkin Chai Latte for a cozy, fall-inspired treat. Whether you're savoring them alone or sharing with friends, our Double Chocolate Cookies offer a rich, indulgent experience in every bite.
