London Fog

Warm up with our comforting London Fog, a carefully crafted blend featuring Earl Grey tea, steamed milk, and a hint of vanilla syrup. Our Earl Grey tea is made with high-quality black tea leaves infused with aromatic bergamot oil, providing a distinctive and refreshing citrus flavor. Paired with steamed milk, which adds a creamy and velvety texture, and a touch of vanilla syrup, our London Fog creates a soothing and well-balanced beverage.

Pair this cozy drink with our Pumpkin Spice Cookies for a heartwarming autumn treat or enjoy it alongside our Oatmeal Raisin Cookies for a wholesome, comforting combination. Whether you're relaxing on a cool day or catching up with friends, the London Fog offers a refined and indulgent experience in every sip.
