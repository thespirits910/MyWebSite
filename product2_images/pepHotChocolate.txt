Peppermint Hot Chocolate

Delight in the festive flavors of our Peppermint Hot Chocolate, a rich and creamy beverage that brings comfort and cheer. Made with premium cocoa powder and real milk, our hot chocolate is blended to perfection for a smooth, velvety texture. Infused with peppermint syrup, which combines peppermint extract with sugar, it delivers a refreshing minty kick. Topped with a generous swirl of whipped cream and a sprinkle of crushed candy canes, this drink offers a delightful mix of creamy, minty, and crunchy textures.

Pair this holiday favorite with our Pumpkin Spice Cookies for a cozy, autumn-inspired treat or enjoy it alongside our Peanut Butter Cookies for a rich, nutty contrast. Whether youâ€™re celebrating the season or simply indulging, the Peppermint Hot Chocolate is sure to bring warmth and joy to every sip.
