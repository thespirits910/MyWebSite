Iced Caramel Macchiato

Enjoy a refreshing and indulgent treat with our Iced Caramel Macchiato, a perfect blend of espresso, cold milk, caramel drizzle, and ice. Our espresso is made from high-quality coffee beans, finely ground and brewed under high pressure to create a rich, bold flavor. Combined with cold milk, which adds a creamy texture and smoothness, this drink is then layered with a generous drizzle of caramel sauce, made from caramelized sugar and cream, for a sweet, buttery finish. Served over ice, it offers a cool and invigorating experience.

Pair this delightful drink with our M&M Cookies for a playful, colorful treat or enjoy it alongside our Double Chocolate Cookies for an extra-chocolatey indulgence. Whether youâ€™re enjoying it as a pick-me-up or a sweet escape, the Iced Caramel Macchiato provides a deliciously refreshing kick in every sip.
