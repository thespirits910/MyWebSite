Iced Coconut Matcha Latte

Transport yourself to a tropical paradise with our Iced Coconut Matcha Latte, a refreshing blend of smooth matcha green tea and cold coconut milk, served over ice. Our matcha green tea is made from finely ground green tea leaves, known for its vibrant color and earthy, umami flavor. Mixed with cold coconut milk, which adds a creamy texture and subtle sweetness derived from the grated meat of coconuts, this latte is both invigorating and indulgent. Served over ice, it provides a cool, refreshing twist to your day.

Pair this tropical delight with our Oatmeal Raisin Cookies for a wholesome, comforting treat or enjoy it alongside our Peanut Butter Cookies for a rich, nutty flavor. Whether you're savoring it as a cool afternoon refreshment or a unique pick-me-up, the Iced Coconut Matcha Latte offers a deliciously exotic experience in every sip.
