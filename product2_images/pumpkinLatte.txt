Iced Pumpkin Chai Latte

Celebrate the season with our Iced Pumpkin Chai Latte, a delightful blend of chai spiced tea, cold milk, and a hint of pumpkin, served over ice. Our chai spiced tea features a rich mix of black tea and aromatic spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and ginger, offering a warm and complex flavor profile. Combined with cold milk for a creamy texture and a touch of pumpkin puree, which adds a subtle sweetness and seasonal flair, this latte is served over ice for a refreshing yet cozy fall treat.

Pair this seasonal favorite with our Pumpkin Spice Cookies for a harmonious fall-inspired duo or enjoy it alongside our Double Chocolate Cookies for a rich, chocolatey contrast. Whether youâ€™re embracing the autumn vibes or simply indulging, the Iced Pumpkin Chai Latte delivers a deliciously spiced and refreshing experience in every sip.
